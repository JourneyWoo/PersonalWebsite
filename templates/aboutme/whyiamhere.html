                <h5>My Personal Statement When I applied for UIUC</h5>
                <br>
                <body>
                    <p>My fascination with machine learning has inspired me to focus on two major aspects of my future academic and career pursuits. Firstly, I hope to learn how to make the machine learn so that it can better serve human beings. Secondly, I hope to learn what is beyond the capacity of machines, such as the critical thinking and learning ability; only in that way, a professional engaged in the information technology field will not be replaced by machines. However, in pursuit of the goal of becoming an IT professional and industry manager, my current knowledge and experience are still not enough to be called “professional. With a determination to commit myself to the rapidly growing IT world driven by data as a data analyst, I hope to pursue further study in Information Management to gain more expertise and develop comprehensiveness.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my undergraduate study, majoring in the Internet of Things Engineering, at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), I laid a solid foundation in coursework study, especially in computer and math. In a heuristic academic environment, I loved to discuss the latest technology and thinking in my interested fields. When I interned at the marketing department of GWC lnc after my fresh year, I was responsible for G-startup project, and the interactions with CEOs of technical start-ups further broadened my vision. In my sophomore year, I was elected as the department minister of Association of Public Relations, leading a department of 40 committee members. Up to now, I have successfully led and participated in 17 volunteer activities. After two years’ diligent learning and exploration, I deemed it high time for me to hone my hands-on ability through taking part in research projects. At the beginning of my junior year, I joined the lab of Intelligent Software and Multimedia in BUPT and was in charge of the project about Calculating Atmosphere Visibility based on Surveillance Video. I found that solving problems is not just about using possessed knowledge, it is also a process of creating innovative solutions to problems, like solving poor-efficiency calculate problem caused by fog weather by combining Koschmieder Law and data fusion.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To follow my passion, I applied and earned the summer research opportunity at Carnegie Mellon University, engaged myself in research on deep learning. With the lead of my advisor, I finished three papers in there and submitted one paper to Scientific Reports as the first author. The research experience in CMU brought me to the cutting edge of deep learning. More importantly, I began to ponder the true meaning of research – to constantly rise to challenges with a positive attitude. One time, I planned to finish building a linear mixed model within five days, but my supervisor told me I should complete this task within three days, encouraging me to set a very high bar for myself. Although it was a hard task for me at that time, I finished it on time finally. Also, the cooperation and communication with other people in this research group made me realize that programming is not a purpose, but instead the reasoning and problem-solving process that really matters. I think the cutting-edge methods I studied at the lab of CMU may become outdated after some years, but learning ability and thinking pattern learned there will benefit me in the later studies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to my academic research, I interned at Lenovo IT Department, SAP Group, to put my knowledge into practice and learn how to solve the problems in the real world. During the internship, one of the main projects was to analyze the user sentiment based on the comment data of Lenovo Personal Computer from JD.com and BestBuy. In order to make full use of user data, I combined the data fusion thinking from the project in BUPT with practical problems in Lenovo and realized a higher accuracy on sentiment analysis. At the same time, when I tried to analyze the sentiment based by the traditional methods, I noticed the Long Short-Term Memory model used by my colleague, which aroused my attention to deep learning. This Internship not only benefited me in the follow-up study but also enabled me to recognize the central role played by the data analyst and project manager in making manufacturing and marketing strategies. In the public opinion monitoring system of Lenovo, SAP HANA platform always encounter the problem that irregular html language of each website and manual operation made real-time access to user-specific feedback data difficult. Having detected this problem, I spent some days optimizing the script and making a packaged automatic trigger program after analyzing the specific circumstances. The method was well recognized and is still used by my group.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After extensive research experiences and internships, I discovered that I instinctively enjoy the innovative process of solving problems. After graduation, I aim to work as a data analyst in leading technology companies, wanting to accumulate experience and insights about the industrial practice. In the future, I am firmly resolved to become an entrepreneur, devoted to launching my own business that will turn imaginative ideas into practical products of benefit. However, I don't think mere technic knowledge is enough to help me become a qualified leader in this field. I believe that MSIM can help me learn how to combine machine with human, just like Steve Jobs said, Technology and Liberal Art.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>UIUC is the best institution for me to pursue a Master’s degree in Information Management. Not simply because of its world-renowned reputation in both faculty and alumni, but more because of one of the professional pathways – Data science and analytics, which match my undergraduate interest and experience very well. Also, the student support, like career guidance, will help me with the internship. With a rich and solid academic knowledge, diverse research experiences, and enduring enthusiasm for innovations and challenges, I believe that I am qualified for this program. I would be truly grateful if granted the privilege of studying in the MSIM program at UIUC iSchool.</p>
